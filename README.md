ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Ben. 

I'm an experienced software developer, mostly in the Microsoft commercial space (C#, Typescript, SQL Server, etc.), trying to establish a presence on GitHub. I've got a few personal projects on the go, which I'll make public on GitHub as I bring them into a relatively stable state.

So far, I've got two public project on GitHub:

- **[eiou](https://github.com/b-h-mck/eiou)**: A simple IOU tracker app. [See it in action](https://eiou-online.com/)
- **[Chess By URL](https://github.com/b-h-mck/ChessByUrl)**: A website for playing chess or sharing chess puzzles via URL. [See it in action](https://chessbyurl.azurewebsites.net/)
